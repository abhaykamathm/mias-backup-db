As was the case elsewhere in Spain, still-life painting did not begin to flourish in the city until the 1640s, and Valencian still lifes are distinguished by their pared-back compositions and somewhat archaic style - what has been described as an 'archaistic charm' (see W.B. Jordan and P. Cherry, Spanish Still Life from Velázquez to Goya, exh. cat., London, 1995, p. 118).",

Aegeus hid his sword, shield, and sandals under a boulder and told Aethra that when their son was old enough to move the rock and return his tokens, he would acknowledge him as his heir. Theseus, full of bravery and ambition, took the dangerous route by land to Athens, where he would encounter the six entrances to the underworld along the way.",

      "description": "Born in Carpentras, Jean-Joseph-Xavier Bidauld moved to Lyon, where he studied with his brother, the landscape and still-life painter Jean-Pierre-Xavier Bidauld (1745-1813). In the late 1770s, the brothers traveled to Switzerland and Provence where they worked for several years. By 1783, Bidauld was in Paris, where he met and probably studied with the preeminent landscape painter of the age, Claude-Joseph Vernet (1714-1789). In 1785 Bidauld traveled to Rome with the assistance of his patron, the art dealer and perfumer Dulac and under the protection of the Cardinal de Bernis. During his five years in Italy, he visited the hill towns of Subiaco and Narni, the mountains in the Abruzzo region, and then went south to Naples. Throughout his Italian sojourn, however, Bidauld's favorite place to sketch and paint was unquestionably the Roman Campagna, where he made numerous trips. While in Italy, the artist favored painting en plein air - of which he was something of a pioneer - and he produced numerous oil sketches on paper, many of which featured in his estate sale.",

      "description": "Between 1841 and 1844, Turner toured Switzerland annually in the late summer months. During these travels he filled portfolios with impressionistic studies of the places he visited, setting down the essence of each scene economically in pencil and watercolour in a way that was far in advance of what contemporary aesthetics considered ‘finished’. The idea was that these sample studies offered potential patrons the opportunity to choose the works they wished to commission Turner to develop on a slightly larger scale and to resolve to a more conventional degree of representation; for example record-breaking works such as The Blue Rigi, Sunrise (1842, Tate; Christie’s, London, 5 June 2006, lot 53). Sets of ‘finished’ watercolors of this kind were completed in 1842, 1843 and 1845 (see I Warrell, Through Switzerland with Turner, London 1995, pp. 149-155).",

On 19 October 1706, he was registered as Mr. Teykenaar (Master Draughtsman) with the Guild of Saint Luke in Delft. His known work consists only of penschilderen – a method of painting or drawing in ink, with pen and wash, on a prepared panel or canvas – resulting in highly refined monochromatic views of mainly harbor views and whaling scenes. The technique became especially popular with marine painters like Willem van de Velde the Elder beginning in the 1640s, but it had been employed to great effect earlier in the century in works like Hendrick Goltzius’ learned Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus (Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus Would Freeze; c. 1600-03; Philadelphia Museum of Art). In his days, his native town was a center of the whaling industry.",

After training in Utrecht with Abraham Bloemaert and Gerrit van Honthorst, Both travelled to Italy in 1638 and, settling in Rome with his brother Andries, joined a thriving community of Dutch and Flemish painters working in the city. He befriended both Herman van Swanevelt and Claude Lorrain, collaborating with the latter on two series of large landscapes for the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid (Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid). Following Andries’ death in Venice in 1642, Jan returned to Utrecht and established himself as a leading painter in the city, becoming the head of the city’s painters guild in 1649.",

The three figures are positioned close to the picture plane, seated before a stone parapet upon which rest several fruits and still-life elements. A host of angels work together to lift a Cloth of Honor behind the seated Virgin and Child, imagery that would have reminded contemporary viewers of Mary’s status as Queen of Heaven. Following a 16th-century pictorial trend for which Joos himself played a key role in popularizing, Joseph here is not the marginalized observer, but an active protector of Christ. He presents the Child a bowl of porridge, or milk-soup, a mixture of milk and bread evoking both the intercessional power of the Virgin and the sacramental eucharistic bread. The seven figs set among the platter",

The majority of van de Cappelle’s winter landscapes were executed on canvas, though a handful, including a painting dated 1653 (sold Christie’s, London, 12 December 2001 for £861,750), were painted on panel.",

Like the setting, the women’s graceful figures, determined expressions and elegant robes lend dignity and solemnity to the depiction of personifications of a basic principle of good government, made clear by the epigraph carved into the base of the plinth: ‘Basis Firma Fedes’ (‘A Firm Basis of Faith’). As Jennifer Montague first recognized (quoted in J. Richardson, loc. cit.), the female figures correspond to the emblems of ‘Fidelity’ and ‘Security’ in Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia, the influential emblem manual whose second edition (1603) was published with woodcut illustrations personifying each allegorical concept (the first French edition appeared in 1636).",

His immense wealth permitted him to purchase the Bisenzo collection in Rome en bloc in 1847, while at almost exactly the same date acquiring from the Prince de Canino about a hundred pictures from the collection of his great-uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch. A keen exhibitor of his new acquisitions, Dudley lent the present lot to the National Exhibition of Works of Art in Leeds in 1868, along with 128 other pictures.",

      "description": "Birgit Schumacher proposed in her catalogue raisonné a dating of circa 1650-52 for this painting (loc. cit.). The early 1650s were a period in which the artist first succeeded, as Schumacher has noted, in ‘capturing convincing depth using an ideational diagonal’ (ibid., p. 65). Similarly, in this period Wouwerman’s staffage became less dominant and the artist better integrated them within a landscape bathed in a diffuse, cool light. While Wouwerman still drew inspiration from other Haarlem artists, including Pieter van Laer and Isack van Ostade, by the late 1640s he had developed into an outstanding painter of horses, depicting them in complicated positions like that of the foreshortened dark horse seen from behind in the painting's right foreground. Such intensely naturalistic qualities cannot be found in the works of his contemporaries.",

      "description": "Birgit Schumacher proposed in her catalogue raisonné a dating of circa 1650-52 for this painting (loc. cit.). The early 1650s were a period in which the artist first succeeded, as Schumacher has noted, in ‘capturing convincing depth using an ideational diagonal’ (ibid., p. 65). Similarly, in this period Wouwerman’s staffage became less dominant and the artist better integrated them within a landscape bathed in a diffuse, cool light. While Wouwerman still drew inspiration from other Haarlem artists, including Pieter van Laer and Isack van Ostade, by the late 1640s he had developed into an outstanding painter of horses, depicting them in complicated positions like that of the foreshortened dark horse seen from behind in the painting's right foreground.

      "description": "Over the course of his three-decade career, Philips Wouwerman became renowned for his abilities as a painter of horses in dramatic sweeping landscapes. While there is no evidence that Wouwerman left his native city of Haarlem to travel to Italy, he too was inspired by the light and landscape that captured the imagination of his Dutch and Flemish contemporaries. He absorbed the visions brought back by his countrymen, particularly Pieter van Laer's depictions of the Roman campagna. Joining the Guild of Saint Luke in 1640, Wouwerman's early work focused on military and genre scenes. By the 1650s Wouwerman developed a greater interest in landscapes and began to use a brighter color palette, two hallmarks of his mature style.",
